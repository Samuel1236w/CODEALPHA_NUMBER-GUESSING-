OVERVIEW 

The Number Guessing Game is a simple console-based program written in C++. In this game, the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player attempts to guess it. With each guess, the program provides hints like “Too high” or “Too low” to help the player get closer to the correct answer.

This game is beginner-friendly and demonstrates the use of random number generation, loops, and conditional statements in C++.
